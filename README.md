## Abstract
This paper analyzes how economic incentives, racial segregation, and educational factors influence municipal incorporation across U.S. suburbs. Using comparative, thematic, and statistical methods, along with data from the U.S. Census and NCES, the study highlights that higher-income communities often pursue incorporation to maintain tax bases and zoning autonomy. While incorporation may increase property values, it can also intensify segregation. Educational advantages and community identity are also shown to play critical roles in incorporation decisions.

- **Segregation:** Exclusionary zoning may increase racial and economic divides.  
- **Education:** Suburban/incorporated areas often show stronger outcomes.  
- **Case Study:** Baton Rouge → incorporation of the City of St. George.
